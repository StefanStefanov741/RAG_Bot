Pollen\\ncounts were determined following the methods in\\nPreston (1985), and ovule and seed number were\\ndetermined from dissection of the siliques. The\\nlateral anthers of S. anomalus average 37,533 pollen\\ngrains per anther, and the lower anthers average\\n16,000 pollen grains per anther, for a total of 107,066\\npollen grains per flower. With an average of 35.3\\novules per ovary, the pollen-ovule ratio is 3,033,\\nwhich is at the low end of the range for allogamous\\nspecies in the Brassicaceae and comparable to that\\nfor S. glandulosus (3,800) (Preston 1985). Strongly\\noutcrossing species in the family, such as Streptan-\\nthus tortuosus, have a much higher pollen-ovule ratio\\n(5,000-10,000) than S. anomalous (Preston 1985;\\n1994). Seed set in S. anomalus was relatively high\\n(mean = 84.9%, range = 55.4-100%).
